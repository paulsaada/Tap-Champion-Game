# Tap-Champion-Game

Two player click game built in JS. This used to be a very simple tutorial project from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course. I revamped the UI and turned the mouse click controls into keyboard controls so two players could play. So grab a friend, agree on a score, use the Z and M keys on your keyboard to play, and the first player to reach the score wins the round!

## Before

Here's what the tutorial project used to look like. This version of the game could only be played by one person even though it was a two player game.

## After

Here's a gif of what it looks like now after I took away the mouse controls, implented keyboard functionality, and styled the UI:
